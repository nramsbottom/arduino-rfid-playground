# RFID Reader Thingy

This is a very rough little application that I put together while experimenting with the Velleman VMA405 RFID read/write module.

## Hardware

Purchase the hardware here: https://www.kjell.com/no/produkter/elektro-og-verktoy/arduino/moduler/rfid-leser-for-arduino-p87046

The manual for the module, which includes wiring instructions, is available here: https://www.velleman.eu/downloads/29/vma405_a4v03.pdf

## Software

There is an Arduino UNO sketch and a .NET 4.8 WinForms app. You may need to adjust the serial port that the WinForms app will listen to.
